Hello! My name is Dmitry.

I was born in St. Petersburg, Russia. I moved to the US in 2000. I now live in London, UK.

I am interested in the history of computing, history of networking, forums, and, especially, text entry systems.

Professionally, I babysit infra. For my last gig, I lead the platform team at Rollbar.

You can check out my [personal site](https://archvile.net) and [Mastodon](https://file-explorers.club/@dmitry).

I've contributed to open source a bit: [urllib3](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/pull/2197), [Rust docs](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/pull/2580), [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli/pull/3374).

In 2021 @shaoster and I [helped quite a few people get vaccinated](https://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/health/2021/03/24/how-two-software-engineers-can-help-you-secure-covid-19-vaccine/4789775001/).

Previously, @dguilak and I started ughMoney. "We track your spending, and send you the bad news." The logo was a sad coin. It was great.

In 2017, [I wrote for Mondo 2000 about the effects spell checkers and autocorrect are having on English](https://archvile.net/2017/12/12/pink-lexical-slime.html))
